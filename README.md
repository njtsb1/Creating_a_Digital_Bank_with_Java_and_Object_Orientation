# Creating a Digital Bank with Java and Object Orientation
Considering the knowledge in the banking domain, I made an object-oriented solution in Java. For this, I interpreted the following scenario: â€œA bank offers its customers two types of accounts (current and savings), as they have deposit, withdrawal and download functionalities (between the institution's own accounts).

## Requests
-Java
- Basics of Java and Object Orientation
- IDE

## License
Distributed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for more information.

## Commands
- Probably your IDE has a button to run the project, if not, follow these steps to run the project:

In `digital-bank\src`:
>javac Main.java

Then type:
> main java

## Abstraction
Ability to concentrate on essential aspects of a domain, ignoring less important or accidental ones. In this context, objects are abstractions of existing entities with no domain in question.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulating means hiding an implementation from objects, creating more concise and easier to use/understand user interfaces. Encapsulation mainly favored two aspects of a system: maintenance and evolution.

## Heritage
Allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class is known to inherit from the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called a derived class.

## Polymorphism
The ability of an object to be made in many ways, or reference, is the ability to treat shapes created from specific classes as objects of a general class. Careful polymorphism means that the object keeps changing, quite the contrary, a type that dies and that type of object, which may not change the way we refer to it.
